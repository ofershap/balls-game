## How It Works

Teams are paired up each round. Each team secretly chooses **Green** (cooperate) or **Orange** (defect):

| Team A | Team B | A Score | B Score |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Green  | Green  | +5      | +5      |
| Green  | Orange | +10     | -10     |
| Orange | Green  | -10     | +10     |
| Orange | Orange | -5      | -5      |

The game runs multiple rounds with a live scoreboard. Teams must decide: cooperate for mutual gain, or betray for a chance at a bigger reward?
